HiHoFile is a library for working with Heavy Iron Studios .HO archive files. HiHoTool is a GUI able to open .HO files, extract (most of) their data to a folder and replace data in an existing archive. More advanced editing (adding and removing data) is not possible yet.

Games which use .HO archives:

* Ratatouille (2007, Xbox 360/PlayStation 3)
* WALL-E (2008, Xbox 360/PlayStation 3/Wii)
* Up (2009, Xbox 360/PlayStation 3/Wii)
* SpongeBob's Truth or Square (2009, Xbox 360/Wii)
* Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse (2012, Microsoft Windows/Xbox 360/PlayStation 3)

HiHoTool's name was initially chosen so it would match the name of [HipHopTool](https://github.com/igorseabra4/HipHopTool), which is a tool for Heavy Iron Studios .HIP and .HOP archives. It initially did not make much sense as there is no such thing as a .HI file (only .HO), but later it was given the backronym "Heavy Iron HO Tool" (HiHoTool).
